# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, use one of these private channels:

- **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**: Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/aikdna/kdna-remote-server/security/advisories/new) page
- **Email**: security@aikdna.com

We aim to respond within 72 hours and provide a timeline for resolution within 1 week.
Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Supported Versions

`kdna-remote-server` is a self-hosted remote-mode projection support surface.
Until the first stable server release, security support tracks the latest
mainline pre-release and the canonical KDNA protocol/runtime surfaces.

| Component | Supported Versions |
|-----------|-------------------|
| KDNA Protocol | Latest tagged release |
| kdna-cli | Latest minor release |
| kdna-remote-server | Latest mainline pre-release |

Older pre-release versions may receive critical security patches on a
case-by-case basis.

## Security Model

`kdna-remote-server` is the self-hosted projection server for remote-mode
assets. It must not expose full private `.kdna` payloads to clients or define
protocol validity, access modes, LoadPlan states, or crypto policy; those
contracts come from `aikdna/kdna` and conforming core/CLI behavior.

For the KDNA Protocol security architecture, see
[GOVERNANCE.md](https://github.com/aikdna/kdna/blob/main/docs/GOVERNANCE.md)
in the main protocol repository.
